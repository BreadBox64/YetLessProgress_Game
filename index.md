# YetLessProgress
YetLessProgress is a lightweight strategy game for Windows & Planned for Linux created using the Processing Develompent Enviroment. The goal is to create a fun military strategy game that still provides some insight into history, in the aim of this goal the game is set around 5 time periods. The first of these is the early exploration period, where players are pitted against eachother as Spain and Portugal try to expand their trade empires. The second period is the colonial period where France and the UK duke it out over eachothers colonies. The third period is the revolutionary period where the UK and US fight over her independence. The next period is the westward expansion period, where American Indians try to hold onto their rights and land against the encroaching United States. The final period is the civil war period where you can fight the war over again and ensure total victory.

## Gameplay

Each player will have their nation composed of territories who have individual stats such as development level or economic strength. You can set policies and negotiate with each territory to keep citizens happy and income high. You can also recuit armies, which are units that can move around the map and only have a limited amount of supplies, making for interesting strategic decisions to shorten supply lines. You also have a limited amount of intelligence about the other side which allows diversionary tactics and ambush attacks. Finally there are neutral regions which can be traded and negotiated with, and depending on how you treat them, may be very friendly or hostile.
